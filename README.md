# LifelineDeathHandler
A Fabric mod designed for the LifelineSMP server.
Used to handle custom death messages, the life system,
Twitch integration via Streamlabs / StreamElements, and
other things.

This mod has been made open-source to show trust towards
players for them to ensure that the mod installed on their
computers can be trusted, and can be easily verified via
decompilation and code verification, and recompilation and
file hashing.

However, no assistance will be given for trying to set this
up on your own server, and you must figure it out yourself
if you plan to use this mod.
